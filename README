Async functions are a bind of an asynchronous function, that allows you to use the await creating the asynchronous promise based behavior, with that, we can await some response.

Javascript is asynchronous, so, when we need to wait for some response, we need to use the event queue of event loop to help us on that, to do it, we can use the promises and async functions.
